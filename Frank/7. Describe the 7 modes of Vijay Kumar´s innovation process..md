Vijay Kumar is a professor at the IIT Institute of Design, the graduate school of design at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and he has developed a model for the innovation process that consists of seven modes. These modes, as described in his book "101 Design Methods," represent a framework that can be used to convert observations into insights, insights into opportunities, and opportunities into innovations.

Here are the seven modes:

1. Sense Intent: In this mode, the aim is to identify the opportunity for innovation. This involves understanding the problem domain, identifying stakeholders, and setting objectives for the innovation process.
2. Know Context: In this mode, the focus is on researching the context in which the innovation will operate. This may involve understanding the needs, desires, and behaviors of users, as well as studying trends, technology, and the competitive landscape.
3. Know People: In this mode, the focus is on deeply understanding the people who will be using the innovation. This might involve ethnographic research, user interviews, or other methods of gathering qualitative data about users.
4. Frame Insights: Insights are formed by synthesizing the data collected about the context and the people. These insights help to frame the problem in a new way, revealing opportunities for innovation.
5. Explore Concepts: Once the insights are framed, they are used to generate a wide range of possible concepts. The focus is on quantity and diversity of ideas at this stage.
6. Frame Solutions: In this mode, the concepts are evaluated, and a small number of solutions are selected for further development. These solutions are then detailed and framed, considering the value proposition, business model, and technical feasibility.
7. Realize Offerings: In the final mode, the solutions are transformed into concrete offerings. This might involve prototyping, testing, and iterating on the design, as well as planning for production and launch.

These seven modes represent a structured approach to innovation, but the process is not necessarily linear. In practice, teams might iterate through several cycles of these modes, or jump back and forth between modes as needed.
