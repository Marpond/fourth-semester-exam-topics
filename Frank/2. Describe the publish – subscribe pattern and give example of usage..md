The publish-subscribe pattern, also known as the pub-sub pattern, is a messaging pattern in software architecture where message senders, called publishers, do not directly communicate with specific message receivers, called subscribers. Instead, publishers publish messages to a central entity known as a message broker or event bus, which then distributes the messages to all interested subscribers.

The publish-subscribe pattern decouples the publishers from the subscribers, allowing for a flexible and scalable communication model. Publishers and subscribers are not aware of each other's existence, and they can join or leave the system without affecting the others.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of the publish-subscribe pattern:
```cs
// Define a simple event data class
public class MessageEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public string Message { get; set; }
}

// Define a publisher class
public class Publisher
{
    // Declare an event using the EventHandler delegate
    public event EventHandler<MessageEventArgs> MessagePublished;

    public void PublishMessage(string message)
    {
        // Publish the message by raising the event
        MessagePublished?.Invoke(this, new MessageEventArgs { Message = message });
    }
}

// Define a subscriber class
public class Subscriber
{
    public Subscriber(Publisher publisher)
    {
        // Subscribe to the publisher's event
        publisher.MessagePublished += HandleMessagePublished;
    }

    // Event handler for the published message
    private void HandleMessagePublished(object sender, MessageEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Received message: " + e.Message);
    }
}

// Usage example
public static void Main()
{
    Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
    Subscriber subscriber1 = new Subscriber(publisher);
    Subscriber subscriber2 = new Subscriber(publisher);

    // Publish a message
    publisher.PublishMessage("Hello, subscribers!");

    // Output:
    // Received message: Hello, subscribers!
    // Received message: Hello, subscribers!
}
```
