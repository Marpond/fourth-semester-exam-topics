Bill Buxton, a renowned designer and researcher, has written extensively about the role of sketches and prototypes in the design process. According to Buxton, both sketches and prototypes are essential tools for exploring, communicating, and testing design ideas, but they serve different purposes and should be used at different stages of the design process.

Sketches:

The primary purpose of a sketch is to help explore a wide range of ideas in the early stages of design. Sketches are quick, cheap, and easy to create, which encourages designers to generate a large number of diverse ideas without committing too much time or resources to any single one.

Buxton refers to this as the "designing as idea refinement" approach. Sketches are meant to be tentative and disposable, serving as a medium for conversation and feedback rather than a finished product.

Example: If you're designing a new mobile app, you might sketch out various layouts for the main screen, or different ways of navigating through the app's features. These sketches would be rough and not too detailed, as their purpose is to stimulate discussion and provoke new ideas.

Prototypes:

The purpose of a prototype, according to Buxton, is to test a specific design concept in a form that's as close to the final product as possible. Unlike sketches, prototypes are meant to be interactive, allowing designers to evaluate how the design works in practice and identify any issues or areas for improvement.

Prototypes are more expensive and time-consuming to create than sketches, so they are typically used later in the design process, once a particular design direction has been chosen.

Example: After deciding on a particular layout and navigation style for your mobile app based on your sketches, you might create a clickable prototype using a tool like Figma or Sketch. This prototype would allow you to simulate the user experience of the app, testing things like the flow between screens, the intuitiveness of the interface, and the overall usability of the app.

In summary, according to Buxton, sketches and prototypes are both crucial in the design process. Sketches allow for the exploration and communication of a wide range of ideas, while prototypes enable the testing and refinement of these ideas in a format that closely resembles the final product.
