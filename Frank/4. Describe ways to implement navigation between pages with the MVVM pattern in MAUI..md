1. Command-Based Navigation: In this approach, you use commands in your ViewModel to trigger navigation actions. The ViewModel exposes commands that are bound to UI elements (e.g., buttons) in the corresponding View. When the command is executed, it invokes a navigation service or a navigation-related method in the code-behind of the View, which performs the navigation.

Example:

In the ViewModel:
```cs
public ICommand NavigateToPageCommand => new Command(async () =>
{
    await Shell.Current.GoToAsync("Page2");
});
```

In the View (XAML):
```xml
<Button Text="Navigate to Page 2" Command="{Binding NavigateToPageCommand}" />
```

2. Event-Based Navigation: In this approach, the ViewModel raises events to indicate the need for navigation, and the View subscribes to these events and performs the navigation.

Example:

In the ViewModel:
```cs
public event EventHandler<EventArgs> NavigateToPageRequested;

private void OnNavigateToPageRequested()
{
    NavigateToPageRequested?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
}
```

In the View (code-behind):
```cs
viewModel.NavigateToPageRequested += async (sender, args) =>
{
    await Navigation.PushAsync(new Page2());
};
```

3. Navigation Service: A navigation service is a dedicated class that handles navigation logic. It abstracts the navigation details away from the ViewModel, allowing for more decoupled code.

Example:

Navigation Service:
```cs
public interface INavigationService
{
    Task NavigateToPage2();
}

public class NavigationService : INavigationService
{
    public async Task NavigateToPage2()
    {
        await Shell.Current.GoToAsync("Page2");
    }
}
```

ViewModel:
```cs
public class MyViewModel
{
    private readonly INavigationService navigationService;

    public MyViewModel(INavigationService navigationService)
    {
        this.navigationService = navigationService;
    }

    public async Task NavigateToPage2()
    {
        await navigationService.NavigateToPage2();
    }
}
```

In this approach, the ViewModel relies on the navigation service to perform the actual navigation.

These are just a few examples of implementing navigation with MVVM in MAUI. The approach you choose can depend on factors such as the complexity of your navigation requirements, the size of your application, and personal preference. It's essential to strike a balance between keeping the ViewModels independent of the View while ensuring smooth navigation and a good user experience.
