1. Command-Based Navigation: In this approach, you use commands in your ViewModel to trigger navigation actions. The ViewModel exposes commands that are bound to UI elements (e.g., buttons) in the corresponding View. When the command is executed, it invokes a navigation service or a navigation-related method in the code-behind of the View, which performs the navigation.

Example:

Before navigating to a page, we must register it in the AppShell class' constructor.

```cs
public partial class AppShell : Shell
{
    public AppShell()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        Routing.RegisterRoute(nameof(ExamplePage), typeof(ExamplePage));
    }
}
```

Afterwards, 
```cs
public ICommand NavigateToPageCommand => new Command(async () =>
{
    await Shell.Current.GoToAsync(nameof(ExamplePage));
    // apparently in the latest MAUI version you have to do this retarded shit instead
    await Shell.Current.GoToAsync("///{nameof(ExamplePage)}");
});
```

To use this command in XAML:
```xml
<Button Text="Navigate to Example Page" Command="{Binding NavigateToPageCommand}" />
```
