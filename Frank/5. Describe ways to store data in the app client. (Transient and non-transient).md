Transient Data Storage:

Transient storage refers to storing data that is only needed for the duration of the application run, or even less. In MAUI, you can use the following ways to store transient data:

1. Variables: You can store data in variables inside your classes, such as properties in your ViewModels or Models. These variables will be available for as long as the objects containing them exist.
2. Singleton Services: If you need to share data across different parts of your app, you could create a singleton service that holds this data. You could then inject this service wherever you need access to the data.

Non-Transient Data Storage:

Non-transient storage refers to storing data that should persist across app launches. In MAUI, you can use the following ways to store non-transient data:

1. Preferences: The Microsoft.Maui.Essentials.Preferences class provides a simple way to store small amounts of data in key-value pairs. This is great for storing simple data like user settings.

```cs
Preferences.Set("my_key", "my_value");
string value = Preferences.Get("my_key", "default_value");
```

2. File System: If you need to store larger amounts of data, you can use the file system. The Microsoft.Maui.Essentials.FileSystem class provides access to a private storage area for your app that persists across app launches.
```cs
string filePath = Path.Combine(FileSystem.AppDataDirectory, "myfile.txt");  File.WriteAllText(filePath, "Hello, world!");
```

3. Databases: For complex data models or large amounts of data, you can use a database. SQLite is a popular choice for client-side databases in .NET apps, and it's supported in MAUI with the sqlite-net-pcl library. This lets you create relational databases with full SQL querying capabilities.
```cs
var db = new SQLiteAsyncConnection("mydb.db3");
await db.CreateTableAsync<MyModel>();
await db.InsertAsync(new MyModel { ... });
List<MyModel> items = await db.Table<MyModel>().ToListAsync();
```

Remember that although non-transient data should persist across app launches, it can still be lost if the app is uninstalled or if the device is wiped, so it's important to provide a way to back up important data.
