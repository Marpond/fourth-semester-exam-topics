ZigBee is a high-level communication protocol used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, medical device data collection, and other low-power, low-bandwidth needs.

Here's a brief overview of the three types of devices in a Zigbee network: Coordinator, Routers, and End Devices.

1. Coordinator: There is exactly one coordinator in each network, and it is the device that starts the network when it boots up. The coordinator forms the root of the network tree and might bridge to other networks. There is exactly one ZigBee coordinator in each network since it is the device that started the network originally (the Zigbee specification refers to this as the Trust Centre).
2. Routers: These devices, as the name suggests, can route the data they receive. In other words, they pass the data along from other devices. This is an optional component of the network, and it's up to you whether or not you want to include routers. Routers act as intermediate devices that can communicate with the coordinator, other routers, and end devices. They are capable of running applications and are also involved in multi-hop message communication.
3. End Devices: These are typically low-power, low-cost devices that have specific tasks (e.g., temperature sensing, light control, etc.). They can communicate only with their parent node (either a router or the coordinator) in the network, not with each other, which allows them to be asleep a significant amount of the time, thus giving longer battery life. They have just enough functionality to send and receive information.

In a Zigbee network, all devices are assigned a 64-bit IEEE MAC address (typically hard-coded into the device by the manufacturer), which uniquely identifies the device. Additionally, once the device joins a network, it is assigned a 16-bit network address by the coordinator.

Zigbee uses a mesh network architecture for communication. This means that any device (except end devices) can communicate with any other nearby device as long as they are in range of each other. Mesh networks are self-healing, in that if any pathway is blocked, the data will propagate along other available paths to reach its destination. The network uses AES-128 cryptographic keys for encrypted communication, ensuring secure data transfer.
