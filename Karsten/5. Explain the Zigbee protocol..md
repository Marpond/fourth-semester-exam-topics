The Zigbee protocol is a low-power wireless communication protocol designed for short-range and low-data-rate applications. It is commonly used in wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The Zigbee protocol operates on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and provides reliable and secure communication between devices.

a. Coordinator: The coordinator is a central device in a Zigbee network. It initiates and maintains the network, and it is responsible for forming the network, assigning addresses to devices, and controlling the overall network parameters. The coordinator is the primary controller in the network and can communicate with other devices, such as routers and end-devices.

b. Routers: Routers are intermediate devices in a Zigbee network. They help in extending the network coverage by relaying data between devices. Routers can communicate with other routers, end-devices, and the coordinator. They form the network backbone and enable multi-hop communication, allowing devices that are out of range of the coordinator to communicate through intermediate routers.

c. End-devices: End-devices are the lowest level of devices in a Zigbee network. They can communicate only with the coordinator or with routers. End-devices are typically battery-powered and have limited resources, and they usually operate in a low-power sleep mode to conserve energy. They rely on routers to relay their data to the coordinator.
