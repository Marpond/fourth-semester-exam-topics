Pulse Width Modulation is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to a device or to simulate analog signals using digital signals. It is commonly used in applications such as motor control, LED brightness control, and audio synthesis. PWM works by varying the duty cycle of a square wave signal, where the duty cycle represents the ratio of the pulse width (on time) to the period of the signal.

For example, in Python using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO library, you can generate PWM signals using the `RPi.GPIO` module:
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)

pwm = GPIO.PWM(18, 100)  # Pin 18, Frequency 100 Hz
pwm.start(50)  # 50% duty cycle

time.sleep(5)  # Let the PWM run for 5 seconds

pwm.stop()
GPIO.cleanup()
```
In the above example, the code sets up GPIO pin 18 as an output and creates a PWM object with a frequency of 100 Hz. The `start()` method is used to start the PWM with a 50% duty cycle. The PWM signal will remain active for 5 seconds and then stop using the `stop()` method.
