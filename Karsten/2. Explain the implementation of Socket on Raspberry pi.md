Sockets are a fundamental concept in network programming that allow communication between different devices over a network. On a Raspberry Pi, you can use sockets to implement network communication, such as sending and receiving data over TCP/IP or UDP protocols.

Here's an example of a simple TCP server implementation using sockets in Python on a Raspberry Pi:
```python
import socket

# Create a TCP socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to a specific IP address and port
server_address = ('0.0.0.0', 5000)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(1)

print('Server is listening on', server_address)

while True:
    # Accept a connection
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    print('Received connection from', client_address)

    # Receive data from the client
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print('Received data:', data.decode())

    # Send a response back to the client
    response = 'Hello from the server!'
    client_socket.send(response.encode())

    # Close the connection
    client_socket.close()
```
