The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, enabling them to collect and exchange data over the internet. These devices are often equipped with sensors, actuators, and connectivity options that allow them to interact with the physical world and communicate with other devices and systems. The data collected by IoT devices can be analyzed and used to make informed decisions, automate processes, and improve efficiency in various domains such as healthcare, transportation, agriculture, and smart homes.
