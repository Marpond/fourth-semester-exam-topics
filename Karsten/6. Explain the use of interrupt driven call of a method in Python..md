In Python, an interrupt is an event that interrupts the normal execution of a program and triggers the execution of a specific piece of code known as an interrupt handler or interrupt service routine (ISR). An interrupt-driven call of a method allows you to associate an interrupt with a specific function or method so that it is executed when the interrupt occurs.

Here's an example of using interrupts in Python using the `RPi.GPIO` library on a Raspberry Pi to handle a button press:
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

def button_callback(channel):
    print("Button pressed!")

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)

GPIO.add_event_detect(17, GPIO.RISING, callback=button_callback)

try:
    while True:
        # Your main program logic can continue running here
        pass

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

In the above code, we set up GPIO pin 17 as an input and enable the internal pull-down resistor. We then use the `add_event_detect()` function to detect a rising edge on the pin, indicating a button press. The `button_callback()` function is associated with the interrupt and will be called whenever the button is pressed. The main program logic can continue running while waiting for the button press, and it can be interrupted when the button event occurs. The program will clean up the GPIO when it is interrupted by a keyboard interrupt.
