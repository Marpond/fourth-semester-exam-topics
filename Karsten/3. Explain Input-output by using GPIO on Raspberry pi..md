GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) on the Raspberry Pi allows you to interface with external electronic components such as sensors, buttons, LEDs, and more. You can use Python to control the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to control an LED connected to a GPIO pin on a Raspberry Pi:
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Set the GPIO mode to BCM
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Set the GPIO pin number
led_pin = 17

# Set the GPIO pin as an output
GPIO.setup(led_pin, GPIO.OUT)

# Turn on the LED
GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.HIGH)
time.sleep(1)

# Turn off the LED
GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.LOW)

# Cleanup GPIO
GPIO.cleanup()
```
